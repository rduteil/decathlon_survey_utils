Decathlon Survey project's miscellaneous files

This project was realised during an internship at Solutec.

The main objective was to build a web & mobile platform used by Decathlon's employees to create surveys and gather results.

This repository contains database's (PostGreSQL) and reverse proxy's (NginX) dockerfiles, as well as scripts to handle dockers.
